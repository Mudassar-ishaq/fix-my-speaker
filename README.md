# Using Specific Vibrations: A Deep Look into Phone Speaker Water Removal via Web Apps
When a phone speaker is exposed to water, it begins to emit a muffled sound. This occurs because the surface tension of the water molecules holds droplets firmly within the speaker grille. An unclear audio stream while watching a video, or a distorted voice during an important call, can be incredibly frustrating.
Fortunately, web apps offer a simple, non-invasive solution to address this issue; no downloads or sign-ups are required. Below, we will explore the technology behind these tools: Specifically, what vibrations do they use to clean the speaker, which frequency range is safe for mobile devices, and how are these methods effective at forcing the water out?
## Understanding the Simple Science of Pushing Water Out with Sound
The working science is similar to the Apple smart watch, that uses specific sound vibrations to eject water from speaker holes.
### The Right Frequency (165 Hz)
Dust, lint, and water can accumulate in speakers over time, but these materials do not respond to a single, universal frequency. For water ejection, a low frequency, usually 165 Hz, is effective. This frequency produces strong vibrations that specifically resonate with the speaker components. Web apps use the frequency range from 165 Hz to 265 Hz to make the speaker clear from unwanted particles.
### How Vibrations Work
The chosen low-frequency sound causes the speaker diaphragm to vibrate. This continuously shaking effect breaks the surface tension of water molecules and forces them to get out through the speaker grill.
## How Websites Make the Sound Clean
Web applications are customized to generate precise and effective tones without requiring any installation, relying instead on the phone's native browser functions.
### Using Your Browser
The Power of the Web Audio API Web-based speaker cleaners use a tool called the Web Audio API that is inside your phone's browser. Think of this tool like a tiny sound generator that allows the website's code to create vibrations of 165 Hz and push the moisture out from the speaker.
### Volume is Key: Why Maximum Volume is Essential for moisture ejection
Low sound will cause the speaker to shake slowly, not having the power to break the surface tension of water molecules. On the other hand, full volume will allow the sound to vibrate the speaker diaphragm more powerfully to eject moisture.

## Some commonly used speaker cleaner web apps include:

* Speaker Cleaner
These tools work in a similar way. Follow the steps below for the best results.
### Turn Up the Volume
Increase your phone’s system volume to the maximum level. Higher volume creates stronger sound vibrations, which helps force water out of the speaker grill.
### Place the Speaker Side Downward
Hold your phone so the speaker faces downward. Gravity helps the water move out instead of staying trapped inside.
### Run the Sound 
Start playing the cleaning sound from the [Web App](https://fixmyspeakerz.com) to eject water. The sound creates vibrations that push water droplets out of the speaker openings. Let it run for the recommended time.
### Repeat if Needed
If the sound still feels unclear, repeat the process once or twice. Stubborn moisture may need multiple cycles to fully eject.
### Use a Small Tap Gently
tap the phone against your palm while the speaker is facing down. This can help dislodge the last remaining droplets. Avoid shaking or hitting the phone hard.
### Test the Speakers
Play normal audio, music, or a voice note to check the sound quality. If the audio is clear again, the cleaning was successful.
## Conclusion:
Getting moisture in a phone speaker is a common problem, but addressing the issue using specific sound vibrations is safe and secure for your phone as compared to opening tools. You will notice an improvement in sound; if the issue persists, it may be due to a heavy water buildup in the speaker. Try to get professional help to prevent short circuits and corrosion on delicate parts of the speaker.
